# PHLAME: Phylogeny-aware Lineage Asseignment from Metagenomics
# PHLAME is a novelty-aware approach to classify intraspecies variation using strain-level reference databases. PHLAME uses the assumption that marker SNPs accumulate sequentially along the branches of a phylogeny in order to quantify divergence from a reference database.
